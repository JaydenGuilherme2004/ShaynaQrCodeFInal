    <p class="Lyrics">
      I walk a lonely road<br>
      The only one that I have ever known<br>
      Don't know where it goes<br>
      But it's home to me, and I walk alone<br><br>

      I walk this empty street<br>
      On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br>
      Where the city sleeps<br>
      And I'm the only one, and I walk alone<br><br>

      I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
      I walk alone, I walk a-<br><br>

      My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
      My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
      Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me<br>
      'Til then, I walk alone<br><br>

      Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
      Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br><br>

      I'm walking down the line<br>
      That divides me somewhere in my mind<br>
      On the borderline<br>
      Of the edge, and where I walk alone<br><br>

      Read between the lines<br>
      What's fucked up, and everything's alright<br>
      Check my vital signs<br>
      To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone<br><br>

      I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
      I walk alone, I walk a-<br><br>

      My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
      My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
      Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me<br>
      'Til then, I walk alone<br><br>

      Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
      Ah-ah, ah-ah, I walk alone, I walk a-<br><br>

      I walk this empty street<br>
      On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br>
      Where the city sleeps<br>
      And I'm the only one, and I walk a-<br><br>

      My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
      My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>

      C'mon, raise your hand<br><br>

      Purple rain, purple rain<br><br>

      I only want to see you, only want to see you<br>
      In the purple rain

      Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine<br>
      Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all<br>
      It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?<br>
      It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss<br><br>

      Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab<br>
      While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag<br>
      Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick<br>
      And it's all in my head, but she's touching his<br><br>

      Chest now, he takes off her<br>
      Dress now, let me go<br>
      And I just can't look, it's killing me<br>
      They're taking control<br><br>

      Jealousy, turning saints into the sea<br>
      Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis<br>
      But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me<br>
      Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside<br><br>

      So if you're lonely<br>
      You know I'm here waiting for you<br>
      I'm just a cross-hair<br>
      I'm just a shot away from you<br>

      You leave me broken, shattered I lie<br>
      I'm just a cross-hair<br>
      I'm just a shot, then we can die<br>
      Ah-ah-ah<br><br>

      I know I won't be leaving here<br>

  <button class="faq-question">Fast Car â€“ Tracy Chapman</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p class="Lyrics">
      You got a fast car<br>
      I want a ticket to anywhere<br>
      Maybe we make a deal<br>
      Maybe together we can get somewhere<br>
      Any place is better<br>
      Starting from zero got nothing to lose<br>
      Maybe we'll make something<br>
      Me, myself, I got nothing to prove<br><br>

      You got a fast car<br>
      I got a plan to get us outta here<br>
      I been working at the convenience store<br>
      Managed to save just a little bit of money<br>
      Won't have to drive too far<br>
      Just 'cross the border and into the city<br>
      You and I can both get jobs<br>
      And finally see what it means to be living<br><br>

      See, my old man's got a problem<br>
      He live with the bottle, that's the way it is<br>
      He says his body's too old for working<br>
      His body's too young to look like his<br><br>

      My mama went off and left him<br>
      She wanted more from life than he could give<br>
      I said somebody's got to take care of him<br>
      So I quit school and that's what I did<br><br>

      You got a fast car<br>
      Is it fast enough so we can fly away?<br>
      We gotta make a decision<br>
      Leave tonight or live and die this way<br><br>

      So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>
      Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk<br>
      City lights lay out before us<br>
      And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br>
      And I-I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
      I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>

      You got a fast car<br>
      We go cruising, entertain ourselves<br>
      You still ain't got a job<br>
      And I work in the market as a checkout girl<br>
      I know things will get better<br>
      You'll find work and I'll get promoted<br>
      We'll move out of the shelter<br>
      Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs<br><br>

      So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>
      Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk<br>
      City lights lay out before us<br>
      And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br>
      And I-I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
      I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>

      You got a fast car<br>
      I got a job that pays all our bills<br>
      You stay out drinking late at the bar<br>
      See more of your friends than you do of your kids<br>
      I'd always hoped for better<br>
      Thought maybe together you and me'd find it<br><br>

      I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere<br>
      Take your fast car and keep on driving<br><br>

      So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>
      Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk<br>
      City lights lay out before us<br>
      And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br>
      And I-I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
      I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>

      You got a fast car<br>
      Is it fast enough so you can fly away?<br>
      You gotta make a decision<br>

      Used to spend my nights out in a barroom<br>
      Liquor was the only love I'd known<br>
      But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom<br>
      And brought me back from being too far gone<br><br>

      You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>
      You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br>
      You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br>
      And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br><br>

      I've looked for love in all the same old places<br>
      Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry<br>
      But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it<br>
      'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high<br><br>

      You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>
      You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br>

      Now I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
      That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
      But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
      It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br>
      The minor falls, the major lifts<br>
      The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
      Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
      Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br><br>

      Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
      You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br>
      She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
      She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
      And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br>
      Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
      Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br><br>

      You say I took the name in vain<br>
      I don't even know the name<br>
      But if I did, well, really, what's it to you?<br>
      There's a blaze of light in every word<br>
      It doesn't matter which you heard<br>
      The holy or the broken Hallelujah<br>
